          <p>Each unit has a number of Equipment Slots(ES). On the Bog Thrasher, the number of Equipment Slots(ES) is 3. Each piece of equipment takes up a certain number of Equipment Slots. The RUBY equipment takes up 1 Equipment Slot noted by the single
            (X) symble below its name. The RUBY equipment grants its Unit a permanent boost in its max HP by 2. Some equipment grant its Unit a Special Ability or Special Movement. These Equipment allow your Units to become custamized to your play style

          <h2>Fate</h2>
          <button class="info__click">Click for info</button>
          <p>At the start of the game, each player draws 5 Fate cards from the shared Fate Deck. There are three types of Fate Cards, Numbered Cards, Crystal Cards, And Blessings. Numbered Cards are used when making an attack or defending against an attack
            in a Fate Duel. The number is added to the BAB of an attacking Unit or the DEF of a defending unit. A Crystal Card does nothing for most players. Some Units do take advantage of them. If you have four Crystal Cards and the SOUL Blessing though,
            you can awake The SHATTERING Unit, the strongest Unit in TacticAS(He usually wins you the game). Blessings are special powers that you can use once per turn and they can tilt the game in your favor. Some allow units to make multiple attacks,
            others can even move all units on the board and the SOUL Blessing can even bring your Units back from the dead.</p>
